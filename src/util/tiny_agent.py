It is fairly simple, but still quite powerful: MCP is a standard API to expose sets of Tools that 
can be hooked to LLMs.

But while doing that, came my second realization:

Once you have a MCP Client, an Agent is literally just a while loop on top of it. 🤯

"""
1. Make sure you have `uv` install. (e.g. `brew install uv`)
2. Setup Python venv `uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Setup the model API key (e.g. `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`)
4. Run it! `uv run python tiny_agent.py`

You are an private assistant to perform the task given by the user.

You have several tools at your disposal. A major one is a web browser (running in a macOS).
There are some tricks about using this browser:
    1. Use browser_snapshot function to read the content of the web page.
    2. Many web pages today are lazy loading. That is, it will load more items in a list only when you scroll to the bottom.
    3. When you want to scroll up or down, you have to use the keyboard (e.g. cmd + down to scroll to the bottom).
    4. If you need to input the information you don't have, for example, the login credentials, you can ask a human to intervene and then take on the task from there.
